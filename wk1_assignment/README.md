# sushi-foo
my version of the sushi restaurant review site

This is a NYT web foundaton course assignment.  I was given 1 html doc and 3 stylessheets for the task of optimizing them to be responsive to different screen sizes.  To carry out the task, I first edited the 3 stylesheets to be based on the same html file, then optimized them to be readable on different screen sizes.

The final result is viewable at site: https://sushi-foo-master.netlify.app/wk1_assignment/.  You could switch themes by clicking different tabs of the navigation menu, and review the unformatted html text by clicking the last tab.
