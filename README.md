# sushi-foo
my version of the sushi restaurant review site

This is a NYT web foundaton course assignment.  I was given 1 html doc and 3 stylessheets for the task of optimizing them to be responsible to different screen sizes.  In order to carry out the task, I first edited all 3 stylesheets to be based on the same html file, then optimized all 3 of them to be readable on different screen sizes.

The final result is viewable at site: https://sushi-foo-master.netlify.app/.  By clicking on different themes at the tab menu of the site, the look of the same html file changes accordingly.  The last tab shows the unformatted html text.
